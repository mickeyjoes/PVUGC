Here’s what I checked against Jag’s request about the reduction proof and the GT‑XPDH ➔ DDH ➔ SXDH story:

  ### 1. Code audit vs. reduction assumptions

  I walked through the core pieces that the proof relies on:

  - setup_and_arm (src/api.rs:47–81)
    Generates the statement-only bases Y_j as [β₂] ++ b_g2_query and arms them with a fresh ρ. This matches the lemma’s “statement-only bases, powered by ρ” requirement.
  - OneSidedPvugc::verify (src/api.rs:232–418)
      - Validates the Groth16 proof, DLREP for the B vector, and per-column tie proofs—tying everything back to the verifying key’s b_g2_query.
      - Recomputes R(vk, x) via compute_groth16_target and rejects if the left-hand PPE doesn’t match R, so R is fully determined by (vk, x) and independent of ρ—as the reduction
        needs.
      - Checks R ≠ 1, enforces column/δ subgroup constraints, and the γ₂ exclusion. These prevent the adversary-controlled inputs that would otherwise violate the reduction’s promise.
  - PoCE (src/poce.rs)
    Binds {Y_j^ρ}, Δ^ρ, T_i, and the ciphertext/tag into the Fiat–Shamir challenge, forcing any attestation to use the same ρ throughout.
  - OneSidedPvugc::decapsulate (src/decap.rs)
    With the above guards, decapsulation reduces exactly to computing R^ρ for the unique statement—i.e., the GT‑XPDH target.

  Taken together, the runtime code enforces the structure the markdown proof assumes.

  ### 2. Vulnerability hunt

  I tried to break the reduction assumptions in a few ways:

  - Tampered Groth16 commitments, DLREP responses, GS commitments, and θ/canceller limbs (the target of Lemma 1/Theorem 1).
    → OneSidedPvugc::verify rejects (see test below).
  - Replayed PoCE proofs, ciphertext/tag pairs, or column arms across independent armings (attack on “uniform R” / same ρ).
    → PoCE verification fails—no cross-session mix-and-match.
  - Mutated DEM metadata (ad_core), ciphertext, or τ.
    → verify_key_commitment_dem catches every flip; recomputing the tag lands back on the published value.

  I didn’t find a path to synthesize R^ρ without producing a valid attestation—in other words, the No‑Proof‑Spend property stands.

  ### 3. Added coverage

  To mirror those checks in CI, I added tests/security_mutations.rs with three suites:

  1. verify_rejects_mutated_bundles
     Synthesizes honest bundles and mutates Groth16/DLREP/GS components. Any tampering triggers verify() to reject.
  2. poce_cross_session_replay_fails
     Builds two honest armings and attempts to replay PoCE proofs/ciphertexts/arms across them. Every replay (wrong ctx_hash, gs_digest, swapped arms, etc.) is rejected.
  3. dem_tag_binding_checks_metadata
     Uses the official DEM helper and flips bits in ad_core, ciphertext, and tag to prove verify_key_commitment_dem actually binds the entire metadata triple.

  Those are in addition to existing “no proof ⇒ no key” tests in tests/test_one_sided_security.rs.

  ### Conclusion

  - I verified the reduction markdown matches the actual implementation: setup_and_arm, verify, PoCE, and decapsulate line up precisely with the assumptions Jag described.
  - I didn’t find a vulnerability breaking the reduction or the No‑Proof‑Spend claim.
  - The new mutation tests (now merged) ensure those edge cases stay guarded.

  If Jag wants further depth—e.g., formal verification of the reduction or fuzzing against the algebraic model—we can scope that next, but at the moment the code and tests are aligned
  with the reduction proof in docs/security/gt-xpdh-reduction.md.
